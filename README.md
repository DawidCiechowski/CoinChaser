## Introduction

A conceptually simple game, based on chasing and collection the coins on the screen, before the time runs out. The player can
play through all the levels on couple of different modes:

- Normal 
- Invisible - player cannot see their character. Player can see their character, when they're close in close proximity to the coin.
- Nitro - player movement is much faster than usual.
- Micro - player character becomes half of its original size.

All the modes can also be combined together.

Player movement is quite simple, WASD can be used for the movement and by holding down left-mouse button, the boost is activated.
